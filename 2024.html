<html><head><title>2024</title><link href="_styles.css" rel="stylesheet"></head><body><h1>2024</h1><p class='subheading'>2024-12-27<p>2024 was, all in all, a good year. I would say I am a very different person from who I was at the end of 2023, and I would say I am a better person as well.</p>
<p>I continued working on fonts, and finished the Macintosh Font Set (now to make a website for them!). Plantin 110 has been on hold for a couple months, but it still holds up. I need to work on my (neo)-grotesque more—a type family?</p>
<p>I learned of Nietzsche and Transcendentalism. I read <em>Civil Disobedience</em> and read parts of <em>Thus Spake Zarathustra</em>, <em>The Gay Science</em>, and <em>Ecce Homo</em>. Also, the smallweb movement (especially Merveilles) has influenced greatly my views on computing and the internet.</p>
<p>I do need to work on my actually <em>doing</em> things, for I feel that I didn't get much done, only learned about what to get done.</p>
<p>In 2025, I will <em>do</em> more rather than <em>learning</em> more. I will practice my craft (a font a month?) and I will actually learn how to program (2 hours / month?).</p>
