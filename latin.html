<p>There are three <em>moods</em> in Latin: the indicative, the imperative, and the subjunctive.</p>
<p>The indicative is most commonly used, and observes or recounts things that exist, have existed, or will very likely exist in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Augustus est imperator.
Augustus is the emperor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The imperative is used to issue commands.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sta!
Stop!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The subjunctive is the mood of possibility: it may/could/should/would happen.
However, the subjunctive also signifies different <em>clauses</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>temporal clause (cum ... subjunctive)</li>
<li>purpose clause (ut ... subjunctive)<ul>
<li>indirect command (ABC verb ..., ut ... subjunctive)</li>
</ul>
</li>
